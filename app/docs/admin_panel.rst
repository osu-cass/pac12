Admin Rights
============

The PAC12 Recreation Challenge contains an admin panel that can be accessed by
users with admin/superadmin rights. For a user to obtain admin/superadmin
status, an existing superadmin (SA) must promote that user from the admin
panel.

Admins and superadmins differ in the permissions they are granted. Whereas an
admin user can only view the totals times of their school, SAs can manipulate
the website.


What Can A Superadmin Do?
=========================

There are nine tabs in the admin panel that can be accessed by a superadmin.
They are:
  * Pages - The user can modify what is displayed on the PAC12 welcome
            page as well as the outgoing registration message
  * Menus - Menus creation 
  * Users - User info modification, specifically: 
            * User type (superadmin, admin, user)
            * Email
            * Username
            * Associated School (SAs can change this entry for themselves to
              view the total times for any school)
            * Password reset
  * Schools - Edit info of schools participating in the PAC12 challenge
  * Badges - Edit badge info and/or create new badges
  * Reports - View school times
  * Challenges - Create new challenge
  * Sponsors - Add new sponsor/edit sponsor info

Entries can also be deleted under their respective tabs.
